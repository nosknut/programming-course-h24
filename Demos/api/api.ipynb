    "Passwords should never be stored as plain text. Instead they should be hashed. A hashing algorithm will take a password and use it to generate a semi-random string of text that can only be reproduced using that exact password. This means that even if the database is stolen, the hacker can not use the passwords to log in. Typically one would use a common hashing algorithm such as sha256, however since a hashing algorithm by design is semi-random and always produces the same output for the same input, this means someone could potentially generate a large database of the 10 million most common passwords, and then simply compare the hashes. To prevent this it is necessary to \"salt\" the password, which typically means simply adding a random string to it. Run the code below to see an example."

    "Some times an API should only allow people do access their own information. For example in spotify, you should be the only one able to change your account information. To identify a user, it would be necessary to add the password to every http request. This is not very secure considering many use the same passwords on multiple websites, and if someone were to intercept one of the requests they would have access to all the users accounts. Instead, an access token is used. A token is a random string of text that is generated by the server when you log in, and is then stored in the web browser and sent with every request. Tokens will typically expire after a certain amount of time, and to refresh them the user must log back in. The server can then check if the token is valid, and if it is, it can be used to identify the user. The token is typically sent in the header of the request, and not in the URL Query String or the Body.\n",
